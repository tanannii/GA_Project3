### Overview
In recent years, Data science has become one of the most popular field. This is all thanks to the rise of technology (especially programming languages, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data). Due to it's popularity, employment of data scientists is projected to grow 36 percent from 2021 to 2031 (much faster than the average for all occupations).

### Problem Statement
With the increased popularity of Data Science and ease of using Technology to build their own skills sets, there is a greater demand in self learning too. Reddit is a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies and passions. Hence, it's a popular avenue to for learners (of data science) to post their questions and search for resolutions.

### Brief summary of your analysis
1. Relationship between ACT and SAT's participation rate
2. Trends of ACT and SAT's Average/Median Participation Rate over the years
3. Trends of ACT and SAT's Average/Median Scores over the years
4. Breakdown of SAT's scores - Math and EBRW


### Conclusions/recommendations
The new SAT format has attracted more students and has increased the participation rate. 
On the other hand, participation rate for ACT has dropped.
However, we do see a greater proportion of students who take both SAT and ACT.

Although the average score of SAT has dropped, the median score of SAT has increased slightly.

Looking at the details of the score, on the whole, scores for Math has improved. 
This could signal that more mathematically strong students are attracted by the change in format, and have decided to try SAT (instead of ACT). 

States who used to participate mainly in ACT, is now taking up SAT. Students are choosing to take up SAT (on top of ACT) to have a chance in both.
